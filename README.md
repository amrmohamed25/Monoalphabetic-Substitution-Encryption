# Monoalphabetic-Substitution-Encryption
In the monoalphabetic substitution encryption, each alphabetic letter is substituted by another 
letter according to the following table:
Plain text :a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
Cipher text:q w e r t y u i o p a s d f g h j k l z x c v b n m
Construct this table and store it in the memory.
Write a program that allowed you to enter a plain text message, encrypt this message using 
the stored table, then decrypt the cipher text to obtain the original text message.
Omit any space between words in your message.
